## Compiling the firmware
Download System Workbench for STM32 from https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html and install it (the IDE is also required by Robot firmware).

Open the IDE by clicking the "System Workbench for STM32" icon on your home screen.

Import the project for Drone firmware by `File -> Open projects from file system` and select this directory as the `import source`.

Compile the firmware by `Project -> Build Project` and you will find the binary at `Debug/Drone.elf`.
